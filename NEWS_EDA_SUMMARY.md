| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Market Performance** | **Poor** | Too broad (45%), high noise |

### B. Recommended Filtering Strategy

**For High-Quality Event Studies**, apply **all** of these filters:

1. **Event Category Filter**:
   - Include ONLY: Earnings, Product Launch, Regulatory/Legal, Analyst Ratings
   - Exclude: Generic "Market Performance" news

2. **False Positive Filter**:
   - Ticker must be in title
   - Maximum 2 tickers per article
   - Content length ‚â•200 characters

3. **Temporal Filter**:
   - Exclude weekend/after-hours for certain event types
   - Consider time-of-day for market reaction analysis

4. **Sentiment Filter** (Optional):
   - For extreme events: |sentiment_polarity| >0.5
   - For regulatory: sentiment <0.2

**Expected Result**: ~10-15% of dataset (40,000-60,000 articles)

### C. Stock Selection Considerations

**Well-Covered Stocks** (Good for event studies):

3. **False Positive Reduction**: Filter articles by relevance score
4. **Missing Data**: Fill gaps for under-covered stocks
