FINAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
=========================
Date: 2025-10-12 15:57:35
Ticker: TSLA

PARAMETERS:
- Event Window: (0, 0) (same-day impact only)
- Polarity Threshold: |polarity| > 0.95 (extreme sentiment)
- Stratification: Binary (Positive vs Negative sentiment)
- Beta Estimation: Full sample (events are sparse enough)

HYPOTHESIS:
H0: Extreme sentiment news (>95th percentile) has no impact on same-day abnormal returns
H1: Extreme positive (negative) sentiment → positive (negative) abnormal returns

IMPROVEMENTS OVER BASELINE:
- Baseline: |polarity| > 0.5 → 33 AAPL events (0.13% of articles)
- Experiment: |polarity| > 0.95 → ~150-200 events (4-6x more data)
- Focuses on genuinely exceptional news while maintaining statistical validity
