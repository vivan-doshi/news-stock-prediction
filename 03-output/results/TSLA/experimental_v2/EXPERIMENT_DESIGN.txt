Date: 2025-10-12 15:49:08
Ticker: TSLA

EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS:
- Event Window: (-5, 1) days (baseline: (0, 0))
- Polarity Threshold: |polarity| > 0.3 (baseline: 0.5)
- Stratification: 4 sentiment quartiles

RATIONALE:
1. Extended window captures pre-announcement effects and next-day reaction
2. Relaxed threshold increases sample size for better statistical power
3. Stratification tests non-linear sentiment-return relationship

HYPOTHESIS:
- H0: News sentiment has no impact on abnormal returns
- H1: Stronger sentiment â†’ larger abnormal returns (monotonic relationship)
