## 🔬 Methodology Highlights

### Robust Statistical Approach

1. **Winsorization**: 1% on each tail to handle outliers
2. **Multiple Tests**:
   - Welch's t-test (parametric)
   - Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric)
   - Permutation test (1,000 iterations)
3. **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: 1,000 iterations, 95% CI
4. **Effect Size**: Cohen's d for practical significance

### Data Quality

✅ **NaN Handling**: Forward/backward filling with intelligent imputation
✅ **Outlier Control**: Winsorization prevents extreme values from skewing results
✅ **Model Quality**: Average R² = 0.42 (good explanatory power)
✅ **Multiple Hypothesis Tests**: Consistent results across parametric and non-parametric tests

### Balanced Filter Criteria

The analysis uses the **Balanced filtering strategy**, which provides optimal trade-off:

- ✅ Ticker in title OR (≤2 tickers AND extreme sentiment |polarity| > 0.6)
- ✅ Content ≥200 characters (substantive articles)
- ✅ Major event categories only (Earnings, Product Launch, etc.)
- ✅ Deduplication (one event per stock-date)
- ✅ Result: **27,134 high-quality news events** (54.6% of trading days)

## 💡 Key Takeaways for Presentation

### 1. News Impact is Real but Sector-Dependent

- **53% of stocks** show statistically significant news impact (p<0.05)
- **Technology and Consumer Staples** show strongest positive news effects
- **Energy sector** shows negative news impact (market anticipation?)

### 2. Magnitude of Effects

- Average abnormal return difference: **+0.03%** (3 basis points)
- Top stocks show **0.4-1.0%** difference (40-100 basis points)
- **META** stands out with **+0.97%** difference (97 basis points!)

### 3. Statistical Robustness

- Multiple test methods all converge on same conclusions
- Bootstrap confidence intervals narrow and don't overlap zero for significant stocks
- High model R² (0.42 average) indicates good factor model fit

### 4. Practical Implications

**For Trading:**
- News-driven strategies may work best in **Technology and Consumer Staples**
- Be cautious with **Energy sector** news (may be priced in)
- Focus on stocks with **high Cohen's d** (META, AAPL, MSFT, WMT, PG)

**For Portfolio Management:**
- **Sector diversification** important - news impact varies significantly
- **Factor models** explain significant variance (R² = 0.42)
- **News filter quality** matters - Balanced filter captures meaningful events

## 📞 Questions to Address in Q&A

**Expected Questions:**

1. **"Why is the overall effect so small (+0.03%)?"**
   - *Aggregation across diverse sectors masks individual effects*
   - *Top stocks show 0.4-1.0% effects*
   - *Sector heterogeneity is key finding*

2. **"Why does AAPL show negative news impact?"**
   - *Market anticipation: information may leak pre-announcement*
   - *High media coverage: news may be priced in quickly*
   - *Or: alternative explanations warrant further investigation*

3. **"Is the Balanced filter the best choice?"**
   - *Yes, for general analysis - optimal precision/recall trade-off*
   - *Captures 27K events (54.6% of days) without excessive noise*
   - *Category-specific filter may be better for targeted analysis*

4. **"How do you handle multiple testing?"**
   - *We use 3 different tests (t-test, Mann-Whitney, permutation)*
   - *All tests must agree for high confidence*
   - *Bootstrap CIs provide distribution-free validation*

5. **"What about event windows beyond (0,0)?"**
   - *Future work: (-1,+1), (-5,+5) windows*
   - *Current focus: immediate (same-day) impact*
   - *Longer windows may capture drift/delayed reaction*

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Statistical Tests Used

| Test | Type | Purpose | Result |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| Welch's t-test | Parametric | Difference in means | 26/49 significant |
| Mann-Whitney U | Non-parametric | Distribution difference | Similar to t-test |
| Permutation test | Resampling | Null hypothesis testing | Validates other tests |
| Bootstrap CI | Resampling | Confidence intervals | Narrow, don't overlap |

### Cohen's d Interpretation

- **|d| < 0.2**: Small effect (negligible)
- **0.2 ≤ |d| < 0.5**: Small to medium effect
- **0.5 ≤ |d| < 0.8**: Medium to large effect ← **META**
- **|d| ≥ 0.8**: Large effect

### Model Fit (R²) by Sector

Best fit: **Finance** (0.59), **Technology** (0.55)
Worst fit: **Healthcare** (0.21), **Utilities** (0.26)

*Lower R² doesn't invalidate results - it means idiosyncratic factors matter more*
