## 📋 Detailed Strategy Analysis

### Strategy 1: Precision (High Quality, Low Volume)

**Philosophy**: Eliminate ALL false positives through strict filtering

**Filtering Criteria**:
- ✅ Ticker MUST be in title (100% requirement)
- ✅ Maximum 2 tickers per article
- ✅ Content length ≥ 200 characters
- ✅ Specific event categories only (Earnings, Product Launch, Regulatory, Analyst Ratings)
- ✅ Deduplicate by title
- ✅ One article per day (highest sentiment magnitude)

**Results**:
- **Articles retained**: 6,426 (3.4%)
- **False positive score**: 0.00 (perfect)
- **Ticker in title**: 100.0%
- **Average articles per stock**: 129 (median: 82)

**Best for**:
- Academic publications requiring highest data quality
- Research where precision > recall
- Stocks with very high coverage (TSLA, AMZN, AAPL)
- When you can afford to lose 96% of data

**Drawbacks**:
- Very low retention may miss important events
- Insufficient data for some stocks (AEP: 56 articles)
- May bias toward certain event types

---

### Strategy 2: Recall (Comprehensive Coverage)

**Philosophy**: Capture as many potentially relevant articles as possible

**Filtering Criteria**:
- ✅ Ticker in title OR extreme sentiment (|polarity| > 0.7)
- ✅ Maximum 5 tickers per article
- ✅ Content length ≥ 100 characters
- ✅ At least one event category match

**Results**:
- **Articles retained**: 99,930 (30.6%)
- **False positive score**: 1.07 (moderate risk)
- **Ticker in title**: 73.6%
- **Average articles per stock**: 1,999 (median: 1,261)

**Best for**:
- Exploratory analysis
- When missing events is costly
- Building comprehensive datasets
- Training ML models (more data)

**Drawbacks**:
- Higher false positive risk (26% don't have ticker in title)
- More noise in the data
- May require secondary filtering
- Potential for multi-ticker article confusion

---

### Strategy 3: Balanced (RECOMMENDED) ⭐

**Philosophy**: Optimize the trade-off between quality and coverage

**Filtering Criteria**:
- ✅ Ticker in title OR (≤2 tickers AND extreme sentiment |polarity| > 0.6)
- ✅ Content length ≥ 200 characters
- ✅ Specific event categories (Earnings, Product Launch, Regulatory, Analyst Ratings, Executive Changes, Dividends)
- ✅ Deduplicate within stock-date pairs

**Results**:
- **Articles retained**: 118,682 (36.8%)
- **False positive score**: 0.83 (low risk)
- **Ticker in title**: 95.6%
- **Average articles per stock**: 2,374 (median: 1,551)

**Best for**:
- **Most event study applications** (recommended default)
- Robust statistical analysis with good sample sizes
- Balance between data quality and coverage
- Stocks with moderate to high coverage

**Why this is optimal**:
1. ✅ Retains sufficient articles for robust analysis
2. ✅ 95.6% ticker-in-title rate ensures high relevance
3. ✅ Low FP score (0.83) indicates good quality
4. ✅ Recommended by algorithm for 37/50 stocks
5. ✅ Good coverage across all event categories

**Drawbacks**:
- May still include some false positives (~4.4% without ticker in title)
- Moderate retention may miss some niche events

---

### Strategy 4: Category-Specific (Tailored Approach)

**Philosophy**: Apply different rules for different event types

**Filtering Criteria by Category**:

**Earnings**:
- Ticker in title + keyword match
- Any sentiment (earnings can be neutral)
- ≤3 tickers (allow sector comparisons)
- Content ≥ 200 chars

**Product Launch / Regulatory**:
- Ticker in title OR extreme sentiment (>0.7 or <-0.3)
- ≤2 tickers
- Content ≥ 300 chars

**Analyst Ratings**:
- Ticker in title REQUIRED
- Single ticker only
- Content ≥ 150 chars

**Executive Changes / Dividends**:
- Ticker in title
- ≤2 tickers
- Content ≥ 200 chars

**Results**:
- **Articles retained**: 20,020 (9.0%)
- **False positive score**: 0.27 (very low risk)
- **Ticker in title**: 90.4%
- **Average articles per stock**: 400 (median: 251)

**Best for**:
- Stocks with low coverage (Utilities, Real Estate sectors)
- Research focusing on specific event types
- When different events require different standards
- Maximizing quality for event-specific analysis

**Why this works well for certain stocks**:
- **EOG, D, AEP, AMT, PLD, CCI**: Low original coverage (563-1,498 articles)
- Category-specific rules preserve more relevant articles for these stocks
- Tailored approach reduces false positives better than blanket rules

**Drawbacks**:
- More complex to implement
- Lower overall volume
- May miss cross-category events

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Choose Your Strategy

Based on this analysis, select:
- **Balanced** for most stocks (recommended)
- **Category-Specific** for low-coverage stocks (Utilities, Real Estate)
- **Precision** only if you need perfect data quality

### 2. Load Filtered Data

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example: Load AAPL balanced filtered data
df_aapl = pd.read_csv('AAPL_balanced_filtered.csv')
event_dates = pd.read_csv('AAPL_balanced_event_dates.csv')

print(f"AAPL filtered articles: {len(df_aapl)}")
print(f"AAPL event dates: {len(event_dates)}")
```

### 3. Run Event Study Analysis

Use the filtered datasets and event dates for:
- Cumulative abnormal return (CAR) analysis
- Event window analysis (e.g., [-5, +5] days)
- Cross-sectional event studies
- Sentiment-driven return predictions

### 4. Consider Further Refinements

Depending on your research goals:
- **Sector-specific thresholds**: Adjust filtering for sector characteristics
- **Time-period filtering**: Focus on specific years or quarters
- **Sentiment-based subsetting**: Analyze positive vs negative events separately
- **Event-specific filtering**: Deep dive into earnings or regulatory events only
