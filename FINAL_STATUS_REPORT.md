## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Experimentation (17 stocks)
Use the 17 stocks with complete stock + news data:

#### A. Feature Engineering
```python
# Stock features:
- Daily returns
- Volatility (5d, 20d rolling)
- Momentum (5d, 20d)
- Volume ratios

# News features:
- Sentiment mean/std
- News count
- Positive/negative sentiment
- Rolling aggregations (1d, 3d, 7d, 30d)

# Market features:
- SPY returns (market)
- Sector ETF returns
- Fama-French factors
```

#### B. Baseline Models
1. Random baseline (mean return)
2. Momentum baseline (past return predicts future)
3. Mean reversion baseline
4. Market beta model

#### C. Prediction Models
1. Linear regression (price features only)
2. Linear regression (news features only)
3. Linear regression (combined)
4. Ridge/Lasso regression
5. Random Forest
6. Gradient Boosting

#### D. Evaluation Metrics
- Direction accuracy (% correct up/down)
- MSE, MAE, R²
- Sharpe ratio
- Statistical significance tests

### Phase 2: Extended Analysis (54 stocks, price only)
- Run price-based models on all 54 stocks
- Sector-level analysis
- Cross-sector comparisons
- Identify which sectors are most predictable

### Phase 3: News Data Expansion (Optional)
If needed, can explore:
- NewsAPI.org (free tier: 100 requests/day)
- Alpha Vantage News
- Web scraping alternatives
- Different time periods with available data

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

### What We Have
1. **Complete stock price data** for 54 diverse stocks across 10 sectors
2. **Complete news data** for 17 representative stocks
3. **All sector ETF data** for market benchmarking
4. **Fama-French factors** for risk adjustment
5. **Well-documented code** and configuration

### Why 17 Stocks is Sufficient

**Statistical Power**:
- 17 stocks × ~1,200 trading days = 20,400 observations
- Sufficient for training and testing machine learning models
- Enough for statistical significance testing

**Sector Diversity**:
- Covers all 10 major sectors
- Technology (3 stocks) - heavily represented
- Most other sectors (1-2 stocks each)
- Mix of high/low volatility sectors

**Research Questions Answerable**:
✓ Does news predict returns better than chance?
✓ Which sectors show strongest news effects?
✓ Optimal news aggregation windows?
✓ News vs price-only prediction comparison
✓ Statistical significance of results

**Cannot Answer** (without more news data):
✗ Within-sector detailed comparisons (only 1-3 stocks per sector)
✗ Stock-specific vs sector-wide news separation
✗ Comprehensive cross-sector portfolio construction

### Recommended Approach

**START HERE**:
1. Fix the experiment script ([02-scripts/19_comprehensive_17stock_experiment.py](02-scripts/19_comprehensive_17stock_experiment.py))
   - Issue: dropna() removing all data
   - Solution: Handle NaN values more carefully (fillna for rolling windows)
   - Expected runtime: 2-5 minutes

2. Run initial 17-stock experiment
   - Get baseline results
   - Test news prediction models
   - Generate initial insights

3. Extend to 54 stocks (price-only models)
   - Baseline models on all stocks
   - Sector analysis
   - Performance comparisons

4. Document findings and generate visualizations

## 🔧 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Experiment Script Crashes
**Problem**: dropna() removes all data after feature engineering
**Cause**: Rolling window features create NaN values at the start
**Solution**:
```python
# Instead of:
combined_df = combined_df.dropna()

# Use:
combined_df = combined_df.fillna(method='ffill').fillna(0)
# Or drop only first N rows with NaN from rolling windows
combined_df = combined_df.iloc[30:]  # Skip first 30 days
```

### Issue 2: Different Data Formats
**Problem**: Old data (17 stocks) vs new data (37 stocks) have different columns
**Status**: ✓ Fixed - script handles both formats

### Issue 3: Timezone Issues
**Problem**: TSLA has timezone-aware dates
**Status**: ✓ Fixed - using utc=True then tz_localize(None)

## 📈 Expected Experiment Results

Based on literature and initial data assessment:

### Likely Findings:
1. **News provides signal**: Direction accuracy ~52-55% (vs 50% random)
2. **Sector differences**: Tech/Finance show stronger news effects than Utilities
3. **Best window**: 3-7 day news aggregation performs best
4. **Combined models**: News + Price outperforms either alone
5. **Statistical significance**: p < 0.05 for news effect

### Realistic Performance Targets:
- Direction Accuracy: 52-56% (modest but actionable)
- R²: 0.01-0.05 (low but expected for daily returns)
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.3-0.7 (for news-based strategy)
- MAE: 1.5-2.0% (mean absolute error in daily returns)

### Publication-Ready Deliverables:
1. **Results table**: Model comparisons across metrics
2. **Visualizations**: Performance by sector, over time
3. **Statistical tests**: T-tests, significance levels
4. **Trading simulation**: P&L from news-based strategy
